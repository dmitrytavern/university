        This repository (<b>"Code - OSS"</b>) is here we (Microsoft) develop
        <a href="#">Visual Studio Code</a> product together with the community.
        Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish
        <a href="#">roadmap</a>, <a href="#">monthly iteration plans</a>, and
        our endgame plans. This source code is available to every one under the

        Visual Studio Code is a distribution of the Code - OSS repository with
        Microsoft specific customizations (including source code), released
        under a traditional Microsoft product license.
      </p>

      <p>
        Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with what
        developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides
        comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along
        with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight
        integration with existing tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You can
        download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on Visual Studio Code's
        website. To get the latest releases every day, install the Insiders
        build.

      <p>
        This repository includes a Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers /
        GitHub Codespaces development container.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          For Remote - Containers, use the
          <b
            ><i>
              Remote-Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...
            </i></b
          >
          command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I. 0 on macOS
          and Windows
        </li>
        <li>
          For Codespaces, install the Github Codespaces extension in VS Code,
          and use the <b><i>Codespoces: Create New Codespace</i></b> conunand
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Docker / the Codespace should have at least
        <b>4 Cores and 6 GB of RAM (8 GB recommended)</b> to run full build. See
        the development container README for more information.
