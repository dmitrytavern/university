# Lab 4.2

Implement adapter using class diagram. The —Ålient is a target interface and the **Wizard** is the adaptee. In order to facilitate the use of **Wizard**, we have created **WizardAdapter** which implements target interface **IFighter** but delegates work to adaptee.

- Added a new **Dragon** class for more demonstrative operation of the adapter pattern.
